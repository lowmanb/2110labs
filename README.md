2110labs
========

The repo contains some notable coursework from cs2110 offered by the University of Virginia in the fall of 2013. It was created for personal use and will only be up for a short time. As this is a temporary clone of a private repo, there is no change history.

Unfortunately, the documentation for this course is no longer available
