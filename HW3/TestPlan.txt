# JUnit Testing Rationale #

* addPlayable()
We created a playlist p and then added all possible types of playlist objects (playlist, song, video) using the addPlayables() method. 
To test whether these objects were actuallyadded, we checked the name of the playables in their respecitve positions in the playlist p.

* addPlayList()
We again created a playlist p, but in this test we only added a playlist using the addPlayList() method. To test whether the playist was added, we 
checked the name of the playlist at index 0 of the playlist p.

* loadMedia()
To comprehensively test our algorithm, we created a text file "test.dat" that contains all of the cases listed in the program spec. After creating 
a new playlist p, we called the loadMedia() method on p directing it to "test.dat". To test whether all the playables loaded correctly, we tested the 
toString() method for all 5 of the playable objects in "test.dat".
